<h2>Life of a Software Engineer</h2>

<p>A day in the life of a software engineer is ever-changing. While there are definite trends across</p><p>the profession, the truth is that software engineers can work just about anywhere. From design</p><p>companies, to finance, to manufacturing, software engineers are needed across the board, and</p><p>that’s exactly what makes this career path so hot.</p>

<h3>Morning</h3>
<p>For the most part, software engineers have very flexible schedules. Part of the glory of working</p><p>with computers is being able to work remotely and also to work at any hour of the day. Based</p><p>on whether you’re a morning person or night person, you’ll arrive at the office and transition</p><p>into work. This time could be spent coding or meeting with co-workers and clients.</p>

<h3>Mid-day</h3>
<p>Another perk of flexible hours means deciding how you lunch. Whether you stay at your desk or</p><p>venture out into the world, a mid-day break can be a great opportunity to chat with coworkers</p><p>and get coding inspiration. After you break, you can jump back into work. Coding is so</p><p>immersive that the hours seem to fly by!</p>

<h3>Evening</h3>
<p>Nighttime is often when the longer hours kick in. Depending on the nature of your work and</p><p>company, you may need to stay at the office later than other professionals. That said, your</p><p>evening end time is typically dependent on your morning start time. As long as you’re putting</p><p>in the hours and staying focused during the day, you can wrap up work at a reasonable hour. Or,</p><p>if you prefer night time working, you can get down to business!</p>
