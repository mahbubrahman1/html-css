      New pilots have the lowest level of seniority and they may start out
      “on reserve,” which means they are on call,
    </p>
    <p>
      typically for about 20 days each month. They fill in if a pilot is
      unable to report for duty, or should new flights be
    </p>
    <p>
      required. Reserve duty requires a pilot to be available and ready to
      fly on short notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pilot is generally only certified to fly on one aircraft type at a
      time. That means that flying assignments are aircraft
    </p>
    <p>
      specific – that is, Boeing 777 pilots are only assigned to routes
      where Boeing 777s are operating.

    <h3 style="color: #6aa792">Flight time vs. duty time</h3>
    <p>
      The time a pilot spends “on the job” does not simply mean the time he
      or she spends on the flight deck operating
    </p>
    <p>an aircraft</p>
    <p>
      In a month, our member pilots may end up actually flying an aircraft
      for up to 118 hours. This flight time – when
    </p>
    <p>
      they are actually at the controls – is also known as “stick time.” But
      actual flight time doesn't come close to
