        morning person or night person, you’ll arrive at the office and
        transition into work. This time could be spent coding or meeting with
        co-workers and clients. Important to software engineering is staying
        up-to-date on industry trends. It’s a good idea to read coding blogs and
        chat with coworkers so you don’t get left behind. For the most part,
