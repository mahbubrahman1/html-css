          Nighttime is often when the longer hours kick in. Depending on the
          nature of your work and company, you may need to stay at the office
          later than other professionals. That said, your evening end time is
          typically dependent on your morning start time. As long as you’re
          putting in the hours and staying focused during the day, you can wrap up
          work at a reasonable hour. Or, if you prefer night time working, you can
          get down to business! Nighttime is often when the longer hours kick in.
